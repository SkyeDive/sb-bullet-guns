# Starbound Bullet Guns
This is a library mod for Starbound which introduces a class (GunFireAmmo) for firearms to let them consume items instead of energy when shooting, not unlike Terraria's gun and bullet system. There are example items included to demonstrate how to add this functionality to your own guns, and code comments have been provided to help make the code easier to understand.

I have no intent of uploading this to the Steam Workshop myself (as I have anxiety), but if anyone seeing this wants to upload it there for ease of access by the community or otherwise, I give you full permission to do so. All I ask is that you remove the example items provided, whether by deleting them or changing their file extensions to be ignored, so that it acts only as a library.
